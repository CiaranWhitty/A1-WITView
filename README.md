# OverAll Idea:

```
1. Timetables: 
            From personal experience using the timetable provide to me by WIT, 
            My timetable had modules which i did not do and made the timetable very confusing, 
            so i thought it would be a good idea to let WIT student to create there own unique timetable  

2. Map: 
            When you first start in WIT, it can be overwelling at first having no idea where to go and which 
            building is which. When i started WIT, i picked up a paper map, of the buildings and rooms, 
            this was very helpful but after using it for sometime, i realised that 
                        1. Not many people know about this map, even though the people around me 
                        wanted one.
                        2. The paper map was very fragile and easy to tear or get damaged
